# Kaggle_NYCTaxi_tripDuration_competition_solution
 
In this project, I will demo using a Kaggle competition dataset (taxi trips in NYC) how to work with csv files from scratch to carry out

    data exploration,
    variable treatment,
    feature variable selection/transformation and
    multiple types of modeling.
